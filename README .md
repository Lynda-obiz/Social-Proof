## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
<!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

While working on this project i learnt more on using flexbox, psuedo class selector, media query and  how to add two images to a background. 
Below are code samples of my project:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
    <div class="box-1">
        <div class="customer">
            <img src="./images/image-colton.jpg" alt="A picture">
            <div>
               <h4>Colton Smith <span>Verified Buyer</span></h4>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {

 .box-1: first-child{
    align-self: flex-start;
}
 .box-1:last-child{
    align-self: flex-end;
}
}
```
 
### Continued development

I will be focusing next on learning media quueries and css grid to perfect my techniques.  

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me on media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to  add two images on a background. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
